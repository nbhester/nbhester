- Hi, I’m Noah Hester and I’m interested in most things IT.  Unrelated, I've never met anyone that does Biztalk.
- Perl5 was my first language that ran in production.
- I am studying for my Cisco CCNP-EI and now with new found desire to earn my CCIE-EI.

- I am settling into Qubes OS for my desktop.  Currently it's on a Compaq/HP desktop (circa 2013) with an i5 cpu and 32GB of ram. A SSD is mandatory.
- I’m into the PinePhone64 with Manjaro Linux OS and if you carry an extra battery and a battery charger it *could* be a daily driver after you add in a low end point 'n shoot for your mobile photos.  Breaking away from the market leaders will not be easy.
