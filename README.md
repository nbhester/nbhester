- Hi, I’m Noah Hester and in spite of joining Github in 2014 this is my first serious foray into it.
- I’m interested in all things IT.
- I’m currently learning python. Perl was my first language that ran in production and I prefer it over python, but python _is_ the new shiny.  Go and Rust are next and maybe C/C++.
- I am studying for my Cisco CCNP and now with new found desire to earn my CCIE.
- I’m looking to collaborate on pinetime64 https://www.pine64.org/pinetime/ yet at the moment that is over my head but I am making progress with small board computers, Raspberry  Pi, et. al., and some progress early adopting the linux based PinePhone64.
