- Hi, I’m Noah Hester and in spite of joining Github in 2014 this is my first serious foray into it.
- I’m interested in all things IT.
- Perl5 was my first language that ran in production and I prefer it over python, but python _is_ the new shiny. 
- I am studying for my Cisco CCNP-EI and now with new found desire to earn my CCIE-EI.
--- 
- I am settling into Qubes OS for my desktop.  Currently its on a Compaq/HP desktop (circa 2013) with an i5 cpu and 32GB of ram.
- I’m ~~looking to collaborate on~~ going to wear a PineTime64 watch (https://www.pine64.org/pinetime/).  Its companion, the PinePhone64 with Manjaro Linux OS, if you carry an extra battery and a battery charger, it *could* be a daily driver after you add in a low end point 'n shoot for your mobile photos.  Breaking away from the market leaders will not be easy. As of 20220812, the phone while functional the update deamon is complaining about a file lock; I'll look at it later.
